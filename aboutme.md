I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the department of biomedical engineering at Northwestern University in Chicago, IL and am advised by [Levi Hargrove](https://www.sralab.org/researchers/levi-hargrove-phd). I currently work in the [Center for Bionic Medicine](https://www.sralab.org/research/labs/center-bionic-medicine) at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, the top rehabilitation hospital in the United States. My [research](https://blair-hu.github.io/projects/) focuses on exploiting human movement and machine learning to improve control of wearable lower-limb assistive devices including prostheses, orthoses, and exoskeletons. You can contact me [here](mailto:blairhhu@gmail.com).
